SafeBrakes v1.1.1
for KSP 1.7.3
by Astronants

==DESCRIPTION==
Because we don't want to see our sstos explode on the landing.
You can activate the brakes with MODkey + BRAKESkey (alt + b by default on Windows).
If on, the antilock system (ABS) temporarily deactivates the brakes to avoid drifting and crashing onto the runway during landing.
The anti-overheat system (SAB) will temporarily deactivates the brakes if the airbrakes are overheating.

==INSTALLATION==
Extract the mod inside your GameData folder.

==SUPPORT==
If you found any bugs, please report it on Github.
