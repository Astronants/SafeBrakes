SafeBrakes 1.1.6
for KSP 1.8.x - 1.12.x
by Astronants
https://github.com/Astronants/SafeBrakes

Save your airbrakes on reentry.

==FEATURES==
You can activate the brakes by pressing the modifier key and brakes simultaneously (alt+b by default on Windows).
When activated, the antilock system (ABS) temporarily deactivates the brakes to avoid drifting and crashing onto the runway during landing.
The anti-overheat system (SAB) will temporarily deactivate the brakes when your aibrakes are overheating.

==INSTALLATION==
Extract the mod inside your GameData folder.

==SUPPORT==
If you find bugs or have suggestions, let me know on Github or the Kerbal Space Program forum.
