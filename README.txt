SafeBrakes v1.1

for KSP 1.7.0

by Astronants



Because we don't want to see our sstos explode on the landing.


You can activate the brakes with MODkey + BRAKESkey (alt + b by default on Windows).
If on, the antilock system (ABS) temporarily deactivates the vessel's brakes to avoid drifting and crashing onto the runway during braking.

Extract the mod inside your gameData folder.

==CHANGELOG==
