You can activate the brakes with MODkey + BRAKESkey (alt+b by default on Windows).
If on, the antilock system (ABS) temporarily deactivates the brakes to avoid drifting and crashing onto the runway during landing.
The anti-overheat system (SAB) will temporarily deactivates the brakes when the aibrakes are overheating.
